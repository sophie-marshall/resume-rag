# Resume RAG
Rertieval Augmented Generation (RAG) meets the application process

## Description

Tired of cramming your experience into a single page resume? Resume RAG explores a world where recruiters can instantly access the full scope of yur work. Instead of relying on vague bullet points, imagine a recruiter interfacing with an LLM enriched with your actual project specs, delivering precist, context-aware insights in real time. 

**Why RAG?**

RAG enhances generative AI by grounding it with trusted, external knowledgeâ€”reducing hallucinations and ensuring factual accuracy. By feeding the LLM curated project details, ResumeRAG aims to offer richer, verifiable candidate profiles beyond the limitations of traditional resumes.
